# Technical Design

Based on the MarTech company case study, this document outlines the technical design for a customer data platform database that handles cross-channel customer data, social CRM, and multi-source data management.

## 1. Identify Application Workload

### Application Context

DataTech Platform (anonymized name) is a MarTech company offering three core services:
- **DataCDP**: Cross-channel customer data platform
- **DataNIX Social CRM**: Multi-community member management platform  
- **Data3DM**: Multi-source data management platform

The platform needs to handle flexible customer data schemas, rapid feature additions, and high-volume data processing for medium to large-scale clients.

### Data Requirements

The application needs to store and process:
- Customer profiles with dynamic fields and custom labels
- Multi-channel interaction data (web, social, mobile)
- Event tracking and behavioral data
- Social community member management
- Campaign and marketing automation data
- Real-time analytics and customer lifetime value metrics

### Workload Table

| Action | Query Type | Information | Frequency | Priority |
|--------|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Create customer profile | Write | customer_id, demographics, contact_info, custom_fields | 10,000 per day | High |
| Update customer attributes | Write | customer_id, field_updates, timestamps | 50,000 per day | High |
| Track customer events | Write | customer_id, event_type, event_data, timestamp | 500,000 per day | High |
| Retrieve customer profile | Read | full customer record with all attributes | 100,000 per day | High |
| Search customers by attributes | Read | filtered customer list based on criteria | 20,000 per day | High |
| Generate customer segments | Read | aggregated customer data for targeting | 1,000 per day | Medium |
| Track campaign performance | Read | campaign_id, customer interactions, conversions | 5,000 per day | Medium |
| Social community member lookup | Read | member profiles, activity history | 50,000 per day | Medium |
| Export customer data | Read | bulk customer data for analytics | 100 per day | Low |
| Generate lifetime value reports | Read | aggregated customer metrics | 50 per day | Low |

## 2. Map Schema Relationships

### Entity Relationship Analysis

**Core Entities:**
1. **Customers** - Central entity storing customer profiles
2. **Events** - Customer behavior and interaction tracking
3. **Campaigns** - Marketing campaigns and automation
4. **Segments** - Customer groupings for targeting
5. **Social_Members** - Social platform member data
6. **Data_Sources** - Track data origin and quality

**Relationships:**
- Customer (1) → Events (Many): One customer has many events
- Customer (Many) → Segments (Many): Customers belong to multiple segments
- Campaign (1) → Events (Many): Campaigns generate many customer events
- Customer (1) → Social_Members (Many): One customer can have multiple social profiles
- Data_Sources (1) → Customers (Many): Data sources provide customer records

### Schema Design Decisions

**Embed vs Reference Strategy:**

1. **Customer Profile (Embed Strategy)**
   - Embed custom fields, preferences, and contact info
   - Embed recent activity summary (last 10 events)
   - Reason: Frequently accessed together, reduces lookups

2. **Events Collection (Separate with Reference)**
   - Store as separate collection with customer_id reference
   - Reason: High volume, time-series data, needs independent scaling

3. **Campaigns (Separate with Reference)**
   - Store separately, reference from events
   - Reason: Shared across many customers, updated independently

4. **Segments (Separate with References)**
   - Store customer_ids as array in segment documents
   - Reason: Dynamic membership, bulk operations

## 3. Apply Design Patterns

### Design Pattern Applications

1. **Computed Values Pattern**
   - Pre-calculate customer lifetime value, engagement scores
   - Store aggregated metrics in customer profile for fast access

2. **Document Versioning Pattern**
   - Track customer profile changes over time
   - Support schema evolution as business needs change

3. **Polymorphic Pattern**
   - Handle different event types (page_view, purchase, email_open) in single collection
   - Support varying social platform data structures

4. **Time-Series Pattern**
   - Partition events by time periods for better performance
   - Use TTL indexes for data retention policies

5. **Extended Reference Pattern**
   - Store frequently accessed campaign details with event references
   - Reduce lookup operations for reporting

### Performance Optimizations

- Index customer profiles by common search fields (email, phone, custom_labels)
- Compound indexes for event queries (customer_id + timestamp)
- Text search indexes for customer name and content searches
- Geospatial indexes for location-based targeting
- Time-series collections for high-volume event data

### Data Quality and Governance

- Schema validation for required customer fields
- Data source tracking for audit and quality monitoring  
- Flexible custom field storage while maintaining query performance
- GDPR compliance through customer data lifecycle management
