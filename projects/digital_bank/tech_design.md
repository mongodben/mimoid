# Technical Design

Based on the digital banking case study, this document outlines the technical design for a digital lending platform database that handles AI-powered microloans, alternative credit scoring, and flexible data processing for unbanked and underserved customers.

## 1. Identify Application Workload

### Application Context

NeoLend Bank (anonymized name) is a digital-first financial institution specializing in microloans to unbanked and underserved populations. The platform uses AI-driven alternative credit scoring that combines traditional structured data with extensive unstructured behavioral and situational data to make rapid lending decisions.

Core services:
- **SmartLoan Platform**: Digital lending app with 24-hour approval process
- **Alternative Credit Scoring**: AI model using structured and unstructured data
- **Microloan Management**: Small loans ($50-$1500) with high volume processing
- **Customer Analytics**: Behavioral analysis and risk assessment

### Data Requirements

The application needs to handle:
- Traditional customer data (names, addresses, phone numbers)
- Alternative data sources (social media, device info, app behavior)
- Loan applications and approval workflows
- Credit scoring models and decision factors
- Payment histories and collection data
- Risk assessment and fraud detection data
- Customer support interactions
- Regulatory compliance and audit trails

### Workload Table

| Action | Query Type | Information | Frequency | Priority |
|--------|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Submit loan application | Write | customer_data, application_details, device_info | 5,000 per day | High |
| Run credit scoring model | Read/Write | structured_data, unstructured_data, score_results | 5,000 per day | High |
| Process loan approval/rejection | Write | application_id, decision, loan_terms | 5,000 per day | High |
| Track loan disbursement | Write | loan_id, disbursement_details, payment_info | 3,500 per day | High |
| Record payment | Write | loan_id, payment_amount, payment_method, date | 15,000 per day | High |
| Check customer profile | Read | full customer record, loan_history, risk_profile | 20,000 per day | High |
| Update risk scores | Write | customer_id, new_risk_factors, score_updates | 10,000 per day | Medium |
| Generate collections report | Read | overdue_loans, customer_contact_info | 1,000 per day | Medium |
| Fraud detection analysis | Read | transaction_patterns, device_fingerprints | 5,000 per day | Medium |
| Regulatory reporting | Read | loan_portfolio, compliance_metrics | 50 per day | Low |
| Customer support lookup | Read | customer_info, interaction_history | 2,000 per day | Medium |

## 2. Map Schema Relationships

### Entity Relationship Analysis

**Core Entities:**
1. **Customers** - Customer profiles with traditional and alternative data
2. **Loan_Applications** - Application submissions and supporting data
3. **Loans** - Active and completed loan records
4. **Credit_Scores** - AI-generated credit assessments
5. **Payments** - Payment transactions and history
6. **Risk_Profiles** - Dynamic risk assessment data
7. **Device_Profiles** - Device fingerprinting and behavior data
8. **Collections** - Overdue loan management
9. **Compliance_Records** - Regulatory and audit data

**Relationships:**
- Customer (1) → Loan_Applications (Many): One customer can have multiple applications
- Loan_Application (1) → Loan (0-1): Application may result in approved loan
- Customer (1) → Credit_Scores (Many): Multiple scoring events over time
- Loan (1) → Payments (Many): Each loan has multiple payment records
- Customer (1) → Risk_Profile (1): Current risk assessment
- Customer (Many) → Device_Profiles (Many): Multiple devices per customer
- Loan (0-1) → Collections (1): Overdue loans enter collection process

### Schema Design Decisions

**Embed vs Reference Strategy:**

1. **Customer Profile (Hybrid Strategy)**
   - Embed basic demographic and contact information
   - Embed current risk score and key metrics
   - Reference detailed alternative data and historical scores
   - Reason: Fast access to core data, while keeping large datasets separate

2. **Loan Applications (Embed Strategy)**
   - Embed all application data including unstructured inputs
   - Embed decision factors and scoring breakdown
   - Reason: Complete application context needed together, relatively static once submitted

3. **Credit Scores (Separate with Reference)**
   - Store as time-series collection with customer_id reference
   - Reason: Historical scoring evolution, ML model versioning

4. **Payments (Separate with Reference)**
   - High-volume transaction data in dedicated collection
   - Reason: Time-series queries, independent scaling needs

5. **Alternative Data (Flexible Schema)**
   - Store varying unstructured data types in flexible documents
   - Support schema evolution as new data sources are added

## 3. Apply Design Patterns

### Design Pattern Applications

1. **Flexible Schema Pattern**
   - Handle varying alternative data sources (social, behavioral, device)
   - Support rapid addition of new data types without schema migration
   - Store both structured and unstructured data in unified documents

2. **Time-Series Pattern**
   - Credit scores, payments, and risk assessments as time-series data
   - Enable trend analysis and model performance tracking
   - Efficient querying of recent vs historical data

3. **Computed Values Pattern**
   - Pre-calculate current risk scores, payment ratios, default probabilities
   - Store aggregated loan portfolio metrics for regulatory reporting
   - Cache frequently accessed customer summaries

4. **Document Versioning Pattern**
   - Track credit model versions and decision factors
   - Support regulatory audit requirements
   - Enable A/B testing of different scoring models

5. **Polymorphic Pattern**
   - Handle different types of alternative data in unified collection
   - Support multiple loan products with varying terms
   - Manage diverse payment methods and channels

6. **Extended Reference Pattern**
   - Store summary loan information with customer records
   - Include key risk factors with loan applications for quick access

### Performance Optimizations

**Indexing Strategy:**
- Customer lookup: phone number, email, national ID
- Application processing: application date, status, risk score
- Loan management: loan status, due dates, payment schedules
- Credit scoring: customer_id + score_date for time-series queries
- Collections: overdue dates, collection status
- Compliance: reporting period, loan origination dates

**Data Partitioning:**
- Partition payments by month for efficient time-range queries
- Separate active vs closed loans for operational vs analytical workloads
- Archive old applications after decision processing

### Alternative Credit Scoring Architecture

**Data Integration Points:**
- Social media profile analysis (with consent)
- Mobile device behavior and app usage patterns
- Location data and mobility patterns
- Transaction history from digital wallets
- Communication patterns and network analysis
- Educational and employment verification data

**Scoring Pipeline:**
1. Data collection and validation
2. Feature engineering and normalization  
3. ML model inference with confidence scores
4. Decision engine with business rules
5. Audit trail and explainability tracking

### Compliance and Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: Strict consent management and PII encryption
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Automated compliance metric calculation
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable decision logs with full data lineage
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies by data type
- **Risk Management**: Real-time fraud detection and monitoring
