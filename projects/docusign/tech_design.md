# DocuSign MongoDB Database Technical Design

## Overview
This document outlines the technical design for a MongoDB database that models DocuSign's electronic signature and document management platform. The design is based on the DocuSign REST API v2.1 OpenAPI specification and captures the core entities, relationships, and workflows needed to support electronic signature operations.

## Business Context
DocuSign is a leading electronic signature platform that enables organizations to:
- Send documents for electronic signature
- Manage signing workflows with multiple recipients
- Track document status through the signature lifecycle
- Store completed documents with comprehensive audit trails
- Create reusable templates for common document types
- Integrate signature workflows into business applications

## Core Entities and Relationships

### 1. Accounts
- **Purpose**: Central tenant entity containing all DocuSign operations
- **Key Attributes**: Account ID, name, billing info, settings, plan details
- **Relationships**: 
  - Has many envelopes
  - Has many users
  - Has many templates
  - Has many brands

### 2. Envelopes
- **Purpose**: Container for documents requiring signatures
- **Key Attributes**: 
  - Status (created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided)
  - Email subject/message
  - Timestamps (created, sent, completed)
  - Expiration settings
- **Relationships**:
  - Belongs to one account
  - Has many documents
  - Has many recipients
  - Has many events (audit trail)

### 3. Documents
- **Purpose**: Individual files within an envelope
- **Key Attributes**: Document ID, name, file content/reference, order, page count
- **Relationships**:
  - Belongs to one envelope
  - Has many tabs (signature fields)

### 4. Recipients
- **Purpose**: People who interact with envelopes
- **Types**: Signers, CC recipients, certified deliveries, agents, editors, witnesses, notaries
- **Key Attributes**: 
  - Recipient type and routing order
  - Email, name, client user ID
  - Authentication requirements
  - Status (sent, delivered, signed, completed)
- **Relationships**:
  - Belongs to one envelope
  - Has many tabs assigned
  - Has many recipient events

### 5. Templates
- **Purpose**: Reusable envelope configurations
- **Key Attributes**: Template ID, name, description, shared status
- **Relationships**:
  - Belongs to one account
  - Has template documents
  - Has template recipients
  - Can generate many envelopes

### 6. Users
- **Purpose**: System users who send/manage envelopes
- **Key Attributes**: User ID, email, name, permissions, status
- **Relationships**:
  - Belongs to one or more accounts
  - Creates many envelopes
  - Has activity logs

## Workload Analysis

| Entity | Write Frequency | Read Frequency | Growth Rate | Query Patterns |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Accounts | Very Low | High | Slow | By ID, by domain |
| Envelopes | High | Very High | Linear | By status, date range, sender, recipient |
| Documents | High | High | Linear with envelopes | By envelope, by template |
| Recipients | High | Very High | 3-5x envelopes | By email, by envelope, by status |
| Templates | Low | Medium | Slow | By account, by name, by usage |
| Audit Events | Very High | Medium | 10-20x envelopes | By envelope, by date range |
| Users | Low | High | Slow | By email, by account |

## MongoDB Schema Design Decisions

### 1. Collection Strategy
- **Separate Collections**: For major entities (accounts, envelopes, documents, recipients, templates, users)
- **Embedded Documents**: For tightly coupled data (tabs within documents, notification settings)
- **References**: For loosely coupled relationships (envelope → account, recipient → user)

### 2. Document Structure Optimizations
- **Envelopes**: Embed summary recipient info for quick status display
- **Documents**: Store metadata separately from binary content
- **Recipients**: Denormalize envelope status to avoid lookups
- **Audit Events**: Time-series optimized collection with envelope references

### 3. Indexing Strategy
- **Compound Indexes**: 
  - Envelopes: (accountId, status, sentDateTime)
  - Recipients: (email, envelopeId, status)
  - Audit Events: (envelopeId, timestamp)
- **Text Indexes**: On envelope subject, document names for search
- **TTL Indexes**: On expired/voided envelopes for cleanup

### 4. Performance Considerations
- **Pagination**: Implement cursor-based pagination for large result sets
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed templates and account settings
- **Aggregation Pipelines**: For complex reporting queries
- **Sharding**: By accountId for horizontal scaling

## Key Workflows

### 1. Envelope Creation
1. Validate account permissions and limits
2. Create envelope document with initial status
3. Add documents with tab definitions
4. Add recipients with routing order
5. Send notifications if status = "sent"

### 2. Signing Process
1. Recipient receives notification
2. Authenticate and access envelope
3. Complete assigned tabs
4. Update recipient status
5. Trigger next recipient or complete envelope

### 3. Template Usage
1. Load template definition
2. Clone template structure
3. Merge runtime recipient/document data
4. Create new envelope from merged data

## Data Volume Estimates
- **Accounts**: 10,000-100,000
- **Active Envelopes**: 1-10 million
- **Completed Envelopes**: 100+ million (archived after 6 months)
- **Documents**: 3-5 per envelope average
- **Recipients**: 3-4 per envelope average
- **Audit Events**: 20-30 per envelope average

## Security Considerations
- Encrypt document content at rest
- Hash sensitive recipient data
- Implement field-level access control
- Audit all data access
- Secure API keys and tokens separately
