Based on Cogna Educação's case study, this document outlines the technical design for a comprehensive educational technology platform that handles 2.4 million students, seasonal application spikes, government funding programs (FIES/Prouni), and multi-institutional educational services across Brazil.

## 1. Identify Application Workload

### Application Context

Cogna Educação is Brazil's leading educational organization serving 2.4 million students across B2B and B2C markets with 25,000+ employees. The platform handles seasonal peaks with up to 57,000 applicants submitting forms and 22 supporting documents per cycle within weeks, requiring high availability and rapid processing for government funding programs.

Core systems:
- **Student Application Portal**: Self-service portal for FIES and Prouni government funding applications
- **Document Management**: Automated document processing and verification system
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Multi-institutional student and staff identity management
- **Academic Content Management**: Course materials, assignments, and learning resources
- **Financial Aid Management**: Scholarship and funding program administration
- **Learning Management System**: Virtual classrooms, assessments, and student progress tracking

### Data Requirements

The application needs to handle:
- High-volume seasonal application spikes (57,000 applications with 22 documents each)
- Multi-institutional student enrollment and academic records management
- Government funding program integration (FIES, Prouni, social programs)
- Real-time document verification and approval workflows
- Academic content delivery for 2.4 million students
- Staff collaboration tools for 25,000+ employees
- Automated data archiving and compliance reporting

## 2. Map Schema Relationships

### Entity Relationship Analysis

**Core Entities:**
1. **Students** - Learners across all institutions with academic records and application history
2. **Institutions** - Educational organizations under Cogna umbrella with specific programs
3. **Programs** - Degree programs, courses, and certifications offered by institutions
4. **Applications** - FIES/Prouni funding applications with document submissions
5. **Documents** - Supporting materials for applications with verification workflow
6. **Staff** - Educators, administrators, and support personnel across institutions
7. **Courses** - Individual course offerings with content and enrollment management
8. **Enrollments** - Student registration in specific courses and programs
9. **Assessments** - Assignments, exams, and graded activities
10. **Financial_Aid** - Scholarships, grants, and government funding records
11. **Content** - Learning materials, videos, documents, and educational resources
12. **Academic_Records** - Transcripts, grades, and degree completion tracking

**Relationships:**
- Student (1) → Applications (Many): Students can apply for multiple funding programs
- Application (1) → Documents (Many): Each application requires multiple supporting documents
- Student (Many) → Enrollments (Many): Students can enroll in multiple courses/programs
- Institution (1) → Programs (Many): Each institution offers multiple degree programs
- Program (1) → Courses (Many): Programs consist of multiple course requirements
- Course (1) → Enrollments (Many): Courses have multiple student enrollments
- Enrollment (1) → Assessments (Many): Students complete multiple assessments per course
- Staff (Many) → Courses (Many): Instructors can teach multiple courses
- Student (1) → Academic_Records (1): Each student has consolidated academic records
- Financial_Aid (Many) → Students (Many): Aid programs support multiple students

### Schema Design Decisions

**Embed vs Reference Strategy:**

1. **Students (Hybrid Strategy)**
   - Embed basic demographic and contact information
   - Reference applications, enrollments, and academic records
   - Store computed metrics like GPA and completion status
   - Reason: Student profiles accessed frequently, but academic history requires detailed queries

2. **Applications (Document-Centric Strategy)**
   - Embed application form data and status tracking
   - Embed document metadata but reference full document content
   - Store workflow status and approval chain
   - Reason: Applications are self-contained units requiring atomic operations during peak periods

3. **Courses (Content Management Strategy)**
   - Embed course metadata and syllabus information
   - Reference learning content and assessments for flexibility
   - Pre-compute enrollment statistics and performance metrics
   - Reason: Course information accessed together but content needs independent management

4. **Documents (Archival Strategy)**
   - Store document metadata with verification status
   - Reference full document content in separate collection for archiving
   - Embed approval workflow and compliance tracking
   - Reason: Enables efficient archiving while maintaining verification audit trails

5. **Academic Records (Computed Values)**
   - Pre-calculate GPA, credit hours, and degree progress
   - Embed recent grade history but reference detailed course records
   - Store completion status and certification information
   - Reason: Transcript generation requires fast access to computed academic metrics
