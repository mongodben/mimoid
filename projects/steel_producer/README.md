  }
).pretty()
```

## Data Patterns and Design Decisions

### 1. Time-Series Optimization
Quality checkpoints use MongoDB's time-series collection patterns:
- **High-volume writes**: Optimized for 50K+ daily measurements
- **Time-based queries**: Efficient range queries by timestamp
- **Batch processing**: Bulk insertions for better performance

### 2. Referential Integrity
Maintains data relationships while allowing independent scaling:
- **Facility ‚Üí Lines**: One facility has multiple production lines
- **Batch ‚Üí Checkpoints**: Each batch has hundreds of quality measurements
- **Product ‚Üí Specifications**: Products linked to customer requirements

### 3. Computed Values
Pre-calculated metrics for dashboard performance:
- **Quality scores**: Aggregated from checkpoint measurements
- **Defect rates**: Computed per facility and product type
- **Efficiency metrics**: Rolling averages for production lines

### 4. Flexible Schema
Handles varying steel grades and customer requirements:
- **Chemical composition**: Dynamic element percentages
- **Customer specifications**: Flexible requirement structures
- **Process parameters**: Adaptable to different production methods

## Performance Characteristics

### Data Volume Capacity
- **Daily checkpoints**: 50,000+ measurements
- **Annual capacity**: ~18M quality records
- **Batch processing**: 1,000 documents per insert operation
- **Query performance**: Sub-second response for most operations

### Index Strategy
Optimized indexes for common access patterns:
- **Time-series queries**: Timestamp + facility/line combinations
- **Traceability**: Batch number and heat number lookups
- **Quality analysis**: Defect type and severity combinations
- **Compliance**: Customer specification and test method indexes

### Storage Estimates
Based on sample data generation:
- **Total documents**: ~58,000
- **Database size**: ~45 MB (sample dataset)
- **Production estimate**: ~2-5 GB annually per facility

## Integration Points

### External Systems
The GPQS database integrates with:
- **ERP Systems**: Production planning and inventory management
- **LIMS**: Laboratory Information Management Systems
- **Vision Systems**: Automated defect detection cameras
- **Process Control**: Real-time production parameter systems
- **Customer Portals**: Quality reporting and certification delivery

### API Patterns
Common integration patterns:
```javascript
// Real-time checkpoint insertion
db.quality_checkpoints.insertMany(sensorBatch)

// Defect notification workflow
db.defects.find({ 
  "customer_notification_required": true,
  "resolution_timestamp": null 
})

// Batch quality summary
db.production_batches.aggregate([...qualitySummaryPipeline])
```

## Quality Control Features

- **Specification Limits**: Automated pass/fail determination
- **Correlation Analysis**: Process parameter impact on quality

### 3. Traceability System
- **Heat Number Tracking**: From melting to delivery
- **Batch Genealogy**: Complete production history
- **Material Flow**: Raw material to finished product mapping

### 4. Compliance Management
- **Customer Specifications**: Automated requirement checking
- **Test Certificates**: Laboratory result documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Problems
```bash
# Test MongoDB connection
mongo mongodb://localhost:27017/metasteel_gpqs --eval "db.runCommand('ping')"
```

#### Memory Issues
```bash
# Reduce record counts for testing
CUSTOM_RECORD_COUNTS="facilities=2,products=5,batches=50" uv run python main.py
```

#### Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Check index usage
db.quality_checkpoints.explain("executionStats").find({
  "facility_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "measurement_timestamp": { $gte: ISODate("2024-01-01") }
})
```

### Data Validation
The system includes comprehensive validation:
- **Schema compliance**: Pydantic model validation
- **Referential integrity**: Foreign key relationship checks
- **Data distribution**: Quality score and defect rate verification
- **Index performance**: Query execution time monitoring

## Development and Extension

### Adding New Collections
1. **Define Pydantic model** in `db_schema.py`
2. **Add collection schema** with indexes
3. **Implement seeder method** in `seed_db.py`
4. **Update validation logic** for relationships

### Custom Data Patterns
```python
# Example: Adding equipment sensors
class EquipmentSensor(BaseMongoDbDocumentSchema):
    equipment_id: str
    sensor_type: SensorType
    reading_value: float
    calibration_date: datetime
    # ... additional fields
```

### Performance Tuning
```python
# Batch size optimization
CHECKPOINT_BATCH_SIZE = 1000  # Adjust based on memory
BULK_INSERT_TIMEOUT = 30000   # 30 second timeout
```
