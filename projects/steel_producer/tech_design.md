# Technical Design

Based on the steel manufacturing case study, this document outlines the technical design for a Global Product Quality System (GPQS) database that handles quality control, production monitoring, and defect management across multiple steel production facilities worldwide.

## 1. Identify Application Workload

### Application Context

MetaSteel Industries (anonymized name) is a global steel manufacturer operating multiple production facilities worldwide with 88 million tons annual crude steel production. The company has implemented a comprehensive quality management system that monitors production quality across the entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished products.

Core systems:
- **GPQS (Global Product Quality System)**: Centralized quality control platform
- **DMT (Defects Management Tool)**: AI-powered defect detection and analysis
- **Production Line Monitoring**: Real-time quality checkpoints across 40+ production lines
- **Supply Chain Quality**: End-to-end quality tracking from ore to finished product

### Data Requirements

The application needs to handle:
- High-volume quality checkpoint data (2,000 checkpoints per 2km coil)
- Multi-site production data aggregation across global facilities
- Real-time defect detection and classification
- Historical quality trends and analytics (3+ years retention)
- Production line performance metrics
- Customer quality specifications and compliance
- Material composition and chemical analysis data
- Equipment performance and maintenance correlations

## 2. Map Schema Relationships

### Entity Relationship Analysis

**Core Entities:**
1. **Production_Lines** - Manufacturing line configurations and capabilities
2. **Quality_Checkpoints** - Individual quality measurement points
3. **Products** - Steel products with specifications and batches
4. **Defects** - Detected quality issues and classifications
5. **Materials** - Raw materials and chemical compositions
6. **Equipment** - Production equipment and sensors
7. **Facilities** - Global production sites and locations
8. **Customer_Specifications** - Quality requirements and standards
9. **Test_Results** - Laboratory analysis and measurements
10. **Production_Batches** - Manufacturing batches and lot tracking

**Relationships:**
- Facility (1) → Production_Lines (Many): Each facility has multiple production lines
- Production_Line (1) → Quality_Checkpoints (Many): Each line has numerous checkpoint sensors
- Product (1) → Production_Batches (Many): Products manufactured in batches
- Production_Batch (1) → Quality_Checkpoints (Many): Each batch monitored at multiple points
- Product (Many) → Defects (Many): Products can have multiple types of defects
- Equipment (1) → Quality_Checkpoints (Many): Equipment generates sensor data
- Customer_Specifications (1) → Test_Results (Many): Multiple tests per specification

### Schema Design Decisions

**Embed vs Reference Strategy:**

1. **Quality Checkpoints (Time-Series Strategy)**
   - Store as high-volume time-series data with facility and line references
   - Embed sensor readings and immediate analysis results
   - Reason: High write volume, time-based queries, independent scaling

2. **Production Lines (Embed Strategy)**
   - Embed equipment configurations and sensor mappings
   - Embed current operational parameters and settings
   - Reason: Relatively static configuration data accessed together

3. **Defects (Hybrid Strategy)**
   - Reference checkpoint data and production batches
   - Embed defect classification and analysis results
   - Store image data and AI analysis metadata
   - Reason: Complex analysis data needs fast access while maintaining relationships

4. **Products and Specifications (Reference Strategy)**
   - Separate collections for flexible product catalog management
   - Enable complex querying across product families
   - Support evolving specifications without schema changes

5. **Multi-Site Aggregation (Computed Values)**
   - Pre-calculate facility-level and global KPIs
   - Store aggregated quality metrics for dashboard performance
   - Reason: Avoid expensive cross-facility aggregations in real-time

## 3. Apply Design Patterns

### Design Pattern Applications

1. **Time-Series Pattern**
   - Quality checkpoint data as time-series with automated partitioning
   - Efficient storage and querying of sensor data streams
   - Support for real-time analytics and historical trend analysis

2. **Computed Values Pattern**
   - Pre-calculate quality scores, defect rates, efficiency metrics
   - Store rolling averages and statistical measures
   - Enable fast dashboard and reporting queries

3. **Document Versioning Pattern**
   - Track product specification changes over time
   - Maintain audit trail for quality standards evolution
   - Support compliance and traceability requirements

4. **Polymorphic Pattern**
   - Handle different types of steel products in unified collection
   - Support varying chemical compositions and properties
   - Manage diverse defect types and classifications

5. **Extended Reference Pattern**
   - Store summary quality metrics with production batch references
   - Include key defect indicators for quick filtering
   - Optimize for quality control workflows

6. **Attribute Pattern**
   - Handle varying material properties and chemical compositions
   - Support flexible product specifications and testing parameters
   - Enable schema evolution for new steel grades and properties

### Performance Optimizations

**Indexing Strategy:**
- Time-based indexes for quality checkpoint queries (facility + timestamp)
- Product and batch tracking indexes (batch_id, product_code)
- Defect analysis indexes (defect_type, severity, detection_date)
- Multi-facility aggregation indexes (facility_id + metric_type)
- Customer specification lookups (customer_id, product_family)
- Equipment performance indexes (equipment_id + maintenance_date)

**Data Partitioning:**
- Partition quality checkpoints by time and facility
- Separate real-time vs historical data for different access patterns
- Archive older data while maintaining accessibility for trend analysis

**Aggregation Optimization:**
