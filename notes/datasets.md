## Implementation Ideas

### Data Pipeline Projects
```python
# Real-time Financial Dashboard
collections = {
    "stocks": "Real-time price feeds with technical indicators",
    "companies": "Fundamental data and financial statements", 
    "news": "Market news with sentiment analysis",
    "portfolios": "User holdings and performance tracking",
    "trades": "Transaction history and execution data"
}
```

### IoT & Sensor Networks
```python
# Smart City Monitoring System  
collections = {
    "sensors": "Device registry and metadata",
    "readings": "Time-series sensor data streams",
    "alerts": "Event-driven notifications and thresholds",
    "locations": "Geographic mapping and spatial queries",
    "maintenance": "Device lifecycle and service records"
}
```

### E-commerce & Marketplace
```python
# Multi-vendor Platform
collections = {
    "products": "Catalog with hierarchical categories",
    "vendors": "Seller profiles and business information",
    "orders": "Transaction workflow and fulfillment",
    "reviews": "User-generated content and ratings",
    "inventory": "Stock levels and supply chain data"
}
```

### Healthcare Management
```python
# Patient Care System
collections = {
    "patients": "Demographics and medical history",
    "providers": "Healthcare professionals and facilities", 
    "appointments": "Scheduling and calendar management",
    "treatments": "Medical procedures and outcomes",
    "claims": "Insurance processing and billing"
}
```

### Content Management
```python
# Digital Publishing Platform
collections = {
    "articles": "Content with metadata and versioning",
    "authors": "Writer profiles and collaboration",
    "categories": "Taxonomies and content organization", 
    "analytics": "Reader engagement and performance metrics",
    "subscriptions": "User access and billing management"
}
```

## Data Quality Considerations

### Look for datasets with:
- **Rich relationships** between entities (foreign keys, references)
- **Time-series components** for realistic temporal patterns
- **Geographic elements** for location-based queries and mapping
- **User-generated content** for varied data distributions and quality
- **Business workflows** that mirror real operational processes
- **Hierarchical structures** (categories, organizations, taxonomies)
- **Event streams** (logs, transactions, user interactions)

### Avoid datasets that are:
- Too clean/artificial (no real-world messiness or edge cases)
- Single-table focused (limited relationship modeling opportunities)
- Static snapshots (no temporal evolution or change tracking)
- Overly niche (limited reusability across different use cases)
- Missing key identifiers (poor relationship modeling potential)
- Heavily aggregated (loss of granular transaction-level detail)

## Data Mining Strategy

### 1. Start with APIs
- Live data for dynamic examples and real-time patterns
- Rate limiting considerations for realistic data access patterns  
- Authentication flows that mirror production environments
- Error handling for network failures and service outages

### 2. Use CSV/JSON Dumps  
- Historical data for bulk loading and time-series analysis
- Complete datasets for comprehensive relationship modeling
- Batch processing patterns for large-scale data ingestion
- Data validation and cleaning workflows

### 3. Combine Multiple Sources
- Create realistic data relationships across different domains
- Cross-reference validation (e.g., company data + stock prices)
- Data lineage tracking and source attribution
- Conflict resolution for overlapping information

### 4. Add Synthetic Elements
- Fill gaps with generated data using statistical distributions
- Maintain referential integrity while scaling up data volume
- Create edge cases and error conditions for robust testing
- Generate realistic user behavior patterns and seasonal trends

### 5. Focus on Business Logic
- Emphasize real-world constraints and validation rules
- Model complex business processes and state transitions
- Include regulatory compliance and audit trail requirements
- Capture domain-specific calculations and derived fields

## Usage in Mimoid Projects

When selecting data sources for Mimoid database generation:

1. **Choose datasets that represent complete business ecosystems** rather than isolated data points
2. **Prioritize sources with rich metadata** that can inform schema design decisions
3. **Look for temporal patterns** that can demonstrate time-series collections and indexing strategies
4. **Select data with clear relationships** that showcase foreign key constraints and aggregation opportunities
5. **Include user-generated content** to demonstrate flexible schema design and validation patterns

The goal is to provide Mimoid users with realistic examples of how modern applications actually structure, relate, and utilize their data in production environments.

## Contributing

To add new data sources to this list:

1. Verify the data source is publicly accessible
2. Confirm licensing allows use in sample projects  
3. Test data quality and relationship richness
4. Document any API limitations or usage restrictions
5. Provide example use cases and schema implications
